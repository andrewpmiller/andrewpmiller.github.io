# WTF is this?

This is a repository for a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered blog that I'm hosting on GitHub. I'm using a rather minimal theme called [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) that [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) very generously has provided as an open source [project](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll). I've forked it, cloned it, fiddled with it, and [here](http://presequences.com) it is.

If you want to do something like this, I strongly recommend you read Barry Clark's great article at [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Jekyll is not _quite_ as simple as its creators claim it to be, and so Barry's article (and his [Jekyll Now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) project are very helpful.
