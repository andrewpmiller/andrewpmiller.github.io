This is a blog called _presequences_. The name comes from a concept in linguistics and conversation analysis, although I am not a practitioner of either field.

_Presequence:_[^definition]

1. A presequence is a sequence that
 - is used to introduce a conversational action, and
 - often prefigures a particular sort of action and secures the addressee's cooperation.
2. A presequence is the specific turn that has the function of prefiguring the coming action.

I also once made a [photograph](http://andr3wmill3r.blogspot.com/2012/02/pre-sequences.html) that I gave the same title, based on this same concept.

### about me
I'm a designer who occasionally indulges in technical follies. It occurred to me that I should write down some of the things I do, so that other people can read about them. So rather than just saving these discoveries as [Gists](https://gist.github.com/andrewpmiller), I figured I'd write a bit about them as well.
